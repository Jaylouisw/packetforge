# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Physical-layer model: 32 media types (copper / fiber / DAC / console / wireless),
  9 cage types, per-port media + speed capabilities, and PoE source/sink budgets.
- Live cabling feasibility engine — 11 blocking rules and 5 warnings. Impossible
  cables are refused with a stable error code, both at the API and in the UI.
- Link-type picker: when several media are valid, the user chooses the physical
  medium (and can deliberately force a lower speed, e.g. 100BASE-TX).
- 802.1Q VLAN membership: access/trunk, native VLAN, allowed-VLAN lists.
- LACP / static link aggregation with deterministic hashing and member validation.
- 802.1D spanning-tree election (root / designated / alternate roles, blocking ports).
- `GET /api/media` and `POST /api/topologies/:id/validate-link` endpoints.
- `docs/PHYSICAL_LAYER.md`.
- 202 new test assertions (validation 22, VLAN 59, LAG 57, STP 64).

### Fixed

- The multi-vendor campus example lab cabled a 25G SFP28-only switch to 1G RJ45
  ports — physically impossible. Rebuilt with valid copper and 1G-fiber uplinks;
  the new validator now catches this class of error in CI.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- Event-driven L2/L3/ARP/ICMP simulation engine: MAC learning, unknown-unicast/broadcast
  flooding, longest-prefix routing, default gateways, TTL decrement, ICMP echo/reply.
- Vendor-agnostic Cisco-like CLI (`show`, `interface`, `ip address`, `ip route`, `ping`).
- Browser UI: pan/zoom SVG canvas, port cabling, per-device console, live packet
  animation, WebSocket multi-client sync, topology save/load.
- Hardware catalog: 91 models across 17 vendors — routers, switches, L3 switches,
  firewalls, ONTs/CPEs, access points, and 22 point-to-point radios (Ubiquiti
  airFiber / airMAX AC / GigaBeam / Wave + MikroTik Wireless Wire / LHG / DynaDish / SXT).
- Searchable, manufacturer/type-filtered device palette with collapsible vendor groups.
- Example labs (single-switch, routed campus, multi-vendor WAN) that self-verify.
- CI/CD: test matrix (Node 18/20/22), server smoke test, Docker image published to
  GitHub Container Registry on tags, CodeQL analysis, Dependabot for Actions.
